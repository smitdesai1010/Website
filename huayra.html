<h3>The interior of the Huayra is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. Your mind will be blown. It’s a masterpiece, beyond any compare. The seats are heavenly comfortable, center console is jaw-dropping gorgeous, and the transmission selector is worthy of praise. Mr. Pagani, the chief designer, also took care of powerful high-end stereo systems.
The panel of the navigation screen and climate controls consists in a single 15-pound block of aluminum and is fitted with delicate buttons made to resemble a clarinet keys, because Pagani is a passionate amateur musician.

<h3>As for the body style, the huayra is a classy two-door berlinetta sports car. The designers of this model never left the original idea of active aerodynamics. The entire car is shaped like an elliptical wing, in fact, the flaps of the upper part of the car are designed to behave like little wings. If the driver suddenly turns the wheel, the flaps act in order to prevent excess body roll. Whereas under braking, the flaps lift to behave like air brakes.
