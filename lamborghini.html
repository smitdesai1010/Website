<h1><P> INTERIOR<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=red>

<h3>The interior is largely carried over from the Aventador. Carbon-fiber elements dominate the interior of the Roadster. The carbon-fiber monocoque is clearly visible around the central tunnel and sills. The vehicle comes equipped with two lightweight bucket seats made from Lamborghini’s patented Forged Composite. The entire cockpit, part of the seats and the headliner are wrapped in the lightweight woven carbon-fiber CarbonSkin, which helps shave off a little weight

<h1><P> EXTERIOR<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=#00CCFF>

<h3>The Veneno Roadster looks as if it has been assembled from separate, loosely connected units, accompanied by bulging muscles and an LMP-like dorsal fin at the rear.
Both the front and rear of the vehicle are optimized for underbody aerodynamics as well as high-speed corner stability. Up front, it features a large aerodynamic wing with huge channels and Y-shaped angular headlights, and Lamborghini placed big fenders + 4 sizeable exhaust pipes divided by a splitter on the backside. All the exterior parts are made from carbon-fiber.
To increase the level of downforce peak and the cornering performance, the smooth underbody transitions into a diffuser framing the 4 sizable exhaust pipes which are divided by a splitter. It provides the vehicle with the real dynamic experience of a racing prototype, yet it is completely homologated for the road.

The Veneno Roadster uses Pirelli P Zero tires on 20” alloy wheels up front and 22” wheels in the rear.

It has no actual roof, only a strong rollover bar.

The vehicle comes with an exclusive exterior color – Rosso Veneno, but the customers will also be offered a number of colors.

<h1><P>ENGINE AND PERFORMANCE<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=#FF9900>

<h3>Lamborghini Veneno Roadster uses an L539 6.5-liter V-12 engine. The Aventador engine, which packed 691 hp, was upgraded to deliver 750 hp, by the means of enlarging the air intakes, allowing for higher revs, and modifying the existing exhaust system. The power produced is channeled to all 4 wheels. The engine is paired with a 7-speed, single-clutch automated ISR transmission, an ultra-quick unit that subtly shifts when the track-ready Corsa setting is selected.

The vehicle reaches top speed of 221 mph, four more than the Aventador LP700-4, and develops acceleration 0-60 mph in 2.9 s.
