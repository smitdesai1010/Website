<h3>With Koenigsegg One:1, the manufacturer has managed to reduce the vehicle’s weight, significantly increase bottom end torque, top end power and braking performance. They’ve also introduced new tire technology and more than 500kg extra downforce.
The One:1 is equipped with advanced high modulus carbon fibre chassis with F1 style honeycomb core and integrated fuel tanks for optimal weight distribution and safety.
The vehicle’s monocoque torsional rigidity is 65,000 Nm/degree. It has double wishbones, active ride height control and bevel carbon fibre springs with variable spring ratio.

It sits on Koenigsegg Aircore carbon wheels (front – 19” x 9.5”, rear – 20” x 12.5”) with center locking.

Some other features the One:1 si equipped with are triplex damper in the rear, needle bearings and o-ringed wishbone bushings, fully machined aerospace grade aluminium uprights with SKF LeMans specification 150mm angle contact ball bearings, GKN hollow/gun-drilled driveshaft and Z-style progressive and lightweight anti-roll bars front and rear.

<h3>The One:1 is powered by aluminum 5.0-liter 4-cylinder V8, double overhead camshafts with flex-fuel capability. It delivers over 1000 Nm from 3000 to 8000 rpm of torque (maximum torque being 1371 Nm at 6000 rpm).

The vehicle’s capable of developing acceleration of 0-400 km/h (0-250 mph) in jaw-dropping 20 s, 0-60 mph(0-100 km/h) in 2.5 sec. It reduces the speed of 400-0 km/h in only 10 s, and its braking distance is 28 m (100-0 km/h).

Some other engine and performance features that might interest the enthusiasts follow: the compression of 9.0:1, 1.8 bar boost pressure, sequential, multipoint fuel injection and carbon-fiber intake manifold with optimized intake tracts.
