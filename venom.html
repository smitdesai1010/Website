<h3>The interior styling is still a mystery. But most likely it will be identical to the outgoing model. The cabin just like the exterior is based on the Lotus Exige.  Its door panels, instruments cluster and dashboard are almost identical to those of the Lotus Exige.
The cabin will however receive some Hennessey crafting which include  a carpeted floor, leather upholstery with contrasting stitching, a race-specified steering wheel wrapped in Alcantara, door panels with carbon fiber inserts and softer finishes on the upper dash.  The seats are also modified and for safety, the vehicle comes with a roll cage

<h1><P> EXTERIOR<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=#00CCFF>

<h3>The exterior comes unchanged from last year’s model. Not even has the automaker touched its bumper. The bright-yellow paint job and a touch of black stripe running from the nose to the rear wing, passing across the center of the hood on its way are the only new additions. This is not bad since the Venom GT’s body can be termed as ideal.
The body is stable and highly aerodynamic and after all it wouldn’t make any sense for the company to alter the car’s design. Though the show car was painted in yellow, the Venom GT can be ordered in different exterior colors.

<h1><P>ENGINE AND PERFORMANCE<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=#FF9900>

<h3>In its maiden debut in 2011, the Hennessey Venom GT spitted between 725 and 1200 horses. But for a company possessed by being at the top of supercars business, that was enough.

The Venom still comes with the 7.0 L, V-8. The engine is mated to 6-speed manual transmission system that sends power to the rear wheels only. To pump more power, the designers have increased its turbocharger boost pressure to 26 psi from 19 psi. To make this possible, the engine has been upgraded to run on E85 fuel. This has enabled the engine to add an extra 251 hp to take the total output to 1,451 horses.

This power will enable the vehicle to dash from 0-60 mph in 2.4 seconds from 2.7 seconds in the previous model. The car will do a quarter of a mile in 9.4 seconds while the top speed is expected to exceed 280 mph. Simply put, in an open highway, it takes seconds for the car to disappear from one horizon to the other and if you are with your buddies and one is not focused on the road for a couple of seconds, chances are he will not see the vehicle and will be left claiming you are all lying to him.
