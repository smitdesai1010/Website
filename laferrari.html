<h1><P>INTERIOR<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=red>
<h3>The interior of the Ferrari LaFerrari has a sporty design and a high-level supercar performance. The driver’s seat is fixed and adjusted to the driver, while both the pedal box and steering wheel are adjustable, and the position is similar to that of a single-seat racecar.

The newly-designed steering wheel sports major integrated controls and gear levers which are directly fixed to the steering column.

Other instruments are placed on the suspended-wing-like “bridge” between the seats. These instruments are linked to a dual clutch gearbox.

The instrumentation includes a 12.3? TFT display with the option to choose between two layouts and the ability to host data from the telemetry system

<h1><P>EXTERIOR<Br></h1><Font size=5 color=#00CCFF>

<h3>The LaFerrari was designed by the design team led by Flavio Manzoni, whose goal was to make the perfect combination of form and function.
The aerodynamics were based on the F1. The LaFerrari is equipped with front diffusers and guide vane on the underbody, rear diffusers and spoiler which generate downforce when needed without adding excessive drag. These were developed based on many different performance parameters monitored in real time by the vehicle’s dynamic controls.

On the side, the LaFerrari looks like a typical Ferrari, as it has a downward-sloping nose and a very low bonnet which emphasizes its muscular wheel arches.

<h3>The LaFerrari has the mid-rear mounted F140 V12 6.3-liter engine which delivers 789 bhp and 516 lb-ft of torque. It is supplemented by a 163 PS KERS unit offering extra power to the combustion engine’s output level. The engine is coupled to a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and the vehicle is rear-wheel drive.

It has carbon-ceramic Brembo discs on the front and rear and sits on Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. It also has a double wishbone suspension in the front and a multi-link suspension in the rear.

The LaFerrari’s top speed exceeds 217 mph and is capable of developing acceleration of 0-60 mph (100 km/h)in less than 3 seconds,  124 mph (200 km/h) in under seven seconds, and a speed of 186 mph (300 km/h) in 15 seconds. According to the manufacturer, it’s the fastest road-legal car they have ever produced.

The vehicle has plenty of electronic controls including ESC stability control, high performance ABS/EBD, EF1-Trac F1 electronic traction control integrated with the hybrid system, E-Diff 3 third generation electronic differential, SCM-E Frs magnetorheological damping with twin solenoids, and active aerodynamics to enable maximum performance.
